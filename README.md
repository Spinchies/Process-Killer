# Process-Killer
Application to kill GTA5 and Cheat Engine with a textbox to input another applications name.

This was made because Stand Menu keeps the GTA executable running in the background when it crashes and it's difficult
to find in task manager. 

The cheat engine part is because even when you close cheat engine, it's still running. EZ Ban in games.
